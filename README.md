# YOLOR
implementation of paper - [You Only Learn One Representation: Unified Network for Multiple Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04206)

## About the repo

This repo is the example of detecting objects via class-based inference structure and counting specified objects

## Get Started

Before everything, you must have cuda-cudnn-torch installed. (Preffered Cuda-11.3, Cudnn-8.2.1 and Pytorch for Cuda 11.3)
You can download pretrained weights via https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tdn3yqpZ79X7R1Ql0zNlNScB1Dv9Fp76/view

!!! Use pip3 instead of pip for python3.x 

```
https://github.com/ozgurkaplanturgut/YolorObjectDetectionAndCounting.git
cd YolorObjectDetectionAndCounting
pip3 install -r requirements
```
After these points, you are free to run yolor_inference.py file.
